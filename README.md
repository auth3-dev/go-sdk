# Auth3 Go SDK

The official [Auth3](https://auth3.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sdk&utm_campaign=go) go SDK library.

## Installation

Make sure your project is using Go Modules (it will have a `go.mod` file in the root if it does already):

```bash
go mod init
```

Then, reference this library in a Go program with import:

```golang
import (
    "github.com/auth3-dev/go-sdk/admin" // Administrative API
)
```

Run any of the normal go commands (build/install/test). The Go toolchain will resolve and fetch the Auth3 admin-go-sdk module automatically.

Alternatively, you can also explicitly `go get` the package into a project:

```bash
go get -u github.com/auth3-dev/go-sdk
```
